# 🤖 AI in Software Engineering – SDG 2 Focus

## 📘 Overview
This project explores how artificial intelligence can enhance software engineering workflows through code automation and predictive analytics. It focuses on SDG 2: Zero Hunger, demonstrating how AI tools can streamline development and support decision-making in resource allocation.

## 🧠 Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion

### 🔹 Objective
Compare AI-generated code (GitHub Copilot-style) with manual implementation for sorting a list of dictionaries by a specific key.

### 🔹 Code Snippets
- **AI-Suggested Version**: Uses Python’s built-in `sorted()` with lambda for concise, efficient sorting.
- **Manual Version**: Implements a custom bubble sort for deeper algorithmic control.

### 🔹 Outcome
Both versions produced correct results, but the AI-generated code was significantly more readable and maintainable. This highlights how tools like Copilot can accelerate routine development tasks while preserving logic clarity.

## 📊 Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation

### 🔹 Dataset
Used the Breast Cancer dataset from `sklearn.datasets` to simulate issue prioritization (high/low).

### 🔹 Model
Trained a Random Forest classifier to predict priority levels based on input features.

### 🔹 Evaluation
- **Accuracy**: ~95%
- **F1 Score**: High weighted score indicating balanced performance

### 🔹 Insight
Machine learning can support smarter resource allocation by identifying high-priority cases early, improving efficiency in software maintenance or health-related systems.

## ⚖️ Ethical Reflection

AI systems must be designed with fairness and inclusivity in mind. This project highlighted risks such as dataset bias and underrepresentation, especially when models are deployed in real-world contexts. Ethical AI requires transparency, community engagement, and safeguards to ensure technology serves all users equitably.
