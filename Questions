Q1: AI-Driven Code Generation Tools
Benefits:
Speeds up boilerplate and repetitive coding.
Reduces cognitive load and context switching.
Offers real-time suggestions based on natural language prompts.
Limitations:
May generate syntactically correct but logically flawed code.
Can reinforce biases from training data.
Requires human oversight for security, performance, and readability.

Q2: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning in Bug Detection
Aspect	Supervised Learning	Unsupervised Learning
Input	Labeled bug data	Unlabeled logs/errors
Use Case	Classify known bugs	Discover anomalies or unknown patterns
Example	Predict bug severity	Cluster error logs to detect outliers

Q3: Bias Mitigation in Personalization
AI personalization can unintentionally exclude or misrepresent user groups.
Biases in training data (e.g., gender, region, device type) can skew recommendations.
Mitigation ensures fairness, trust, and inclusivity — especially in diverse user bases like Kenya’s.
